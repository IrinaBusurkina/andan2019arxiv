The memory characteristic of the proposed recurrent attention units offers a rich joint embedding of visual and textual features and enables the model to reason relations between several parts of the image and question. Our single model outperforms the first place winner on the VQA 1.0 dataset, performs within margin to the current state-of-the-art ensemble model. We also experiment with replacing attention mechanisms in other state-of-the-art models with our implementation and show increased accuracy. In both cases, our recurrent attention mechanism improves performance in tasks requiring sequential or relational reasoning on the VQA dataset.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00209v1","cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.CV	cs.NE	stat.ML","Dual Recurrent Attention Units for Visual Question Answering","ahmed.osman@hhi.fraunhofer.de	wojciech.samek@hhi.fraunhofer.de"

However, many short texts occur in sequences (e.g., sentences in a document or utterances in a dialog), and most existing ANN-based systems do not leverage the preceding short texts when classifying a subsequent one. In this work, we present a model based on recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks that incorporates the preceding short texts. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different datasets for dialog act prediction.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03827v1","cs.CL	cs.AI	cs.LG	cs.NE	stat.ML","Sequential Short-Text Classification with Recurrent and Convolutional   Neural Networks","jjylee@mit.edu	francky@mit.edu"

There are many ways to estimate or learn the high-level coarse tokens, but we argue that a simple extraction procedure is sufficient to capture a wealth of high-level discourse semantics. Such procedure allows training the multiresolution recurrent neural network by maximizing the exact joint log-likelihood over both sequences. In contrast to the standard log- likelihood objective w.r.t. natural language tokens (word perplexity), optimizing the joint log-likelihood biases the model towards modeling high-level abstractions. We apply the proposed model to the task of dialogue response generation in two challenging domains: the Ubuntu technical support domain, and Twitter conversations. On Ubuntu, the model outperforms competing approaches by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results according to both automatic evaluation metrics and a human evaluation study. On Twitter, the model appears to generate more relevant and on-topic responses according to automatic evaluation metrics. Finally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is more adept at overcoming the sparsity of natural language and is better able to capture long-term structure.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00776v2","cs.CL	cs.AI	cs.LG	cs.NE	stat.ML	I.5.1; I.2.7","Multiresolution Recurrent Neural Networks: An Application to Dialogue   Response Generation",""

Similarly, deep neural networks can profit from related tasks by sharing parameters with other networks. However, humans do not consciously decide to transfer knowledge between tasks. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), it is hard to predict if sharing will lead to improvements, particularly if tasks are only loosely related. To overcome this, we introduce Sluice Networks, a general framework for multi-task learning where trainable parameters control the amount of sharing. Our framework generalizes previous proposals in enabling sharing of all combinations of subspaces, layers, and skip connections. We perform experiments on three task pairs, and across seven different domains, using data from OntoNotes 5.0, and achieve up to 15% average error reductions over common approaches to multi-task learning. We show that a) label entropy is predictive of gains in sluice networks, confirming findings for hard parameter sharing and b) while sluice networks easily fit noise, they are robust across domains in practice.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08142v2","stat.ML	cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.LG	cs.NE","Learning what to share between loosely related tasks","sebastian@ruder.io,	bingel|soegaard}@di.ku.dk	augenstein@di.ku.dk"

The document is mapped into a uniformly coded text of numerical values. It is derived from the position of the letters in the text line, based on their typographical characteristics. Each code is considered as a gray level. Accordingly, the coded text determines a 1-D image, on which texture analysis by run-length statistics and local binary pattern is performed. It defines feature vectors representing the script content of the document. A modified clustering approach employed on document feature vector groups documents written in the same script. Experimentation performed on two custom oriented databases of historical documents in old Cyrillic, angular and round Glagolitic as well as Antiqua and Fraktur scripts demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method with respect to well-known methods in the state-of-the-art.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.06492v1","cs.CV	cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.LG	cs.NE	97R40, 62H35, 68U15, 68T50,","Document Image Coding and Clustering for Script Discrimination","dbrodic@tf.bor.ac.rs	mjevtic@tf.bor.ac.rs	aamelio@dimes.unical.it	zoran.milivojevic@vtsnis.edu.rs"

In ENAS, a controller learns to discover neural network architectures by searching for an optimal subgraph within a large computational graph. The controller is trained with policy gradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on the validation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Thanks to parameter sharing between child models, ENAS is fast: it delivers strong empirical performances using much fewer GPU-hours than all existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a test perplexity of 55.8, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing.

Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00289v3","cs.AI	cs.CV	cs.LG	cs.NE	stat.ML","Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People",""

The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a general introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this survey, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics like Bayesian treatment of neural networks.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.01662v2","stat.ML	cs.AI	cs.CV	cs.LG	cs.NE","Towards Bayesian Deep Learning: A Survey","hwangaz@cse.ust.hk	dyyeung@cse.ust.hk"

The primary difficulty arises due to insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse, delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process, and (2) the classic ATARI game `Montezuma's Revenge'.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06057v2","cs.LG	cs.AI	cs.CV	cs.NE	stat.ML","Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning: Integrating Temporal   Abstraction and Intrinsic Motivation",""

Given the extensive evidence that motion plays a key role in the development of the human visual system, we hope that this straightforward approach to unsupervised learning will be more effective than cleverly designed 'pretext' tasks studied in the literature. Indeed, our extensive experiments show that this is the case.

Papers provide diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability, and offer myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this ambiguity, many papers proclaim interpretability axiomatically, absent further explanation. In this paper, we seek to refine the discourse on interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing notions.

We propose a novel online dictionary-learning (sparse-coding) framework which incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements), and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the neuronal-birth is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. Neuronal-death is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al.

However, collecting and labeling so much data might be infeasible in many cases. In this paper, we introduce a source-target selective joint fine-tuning scheme for improving the performance of deep learning tasks with insufficient training data. In this scheme, a target learning task with insufficient training data is carried out simultaneously with another source learning task with abundant training data. However, the source learning task does not use all existing training data. Our core idea is to identify and use a subset of training images from the original source learning task whose low-level characteristics are similar to those from the target learning task, and jointly fine-tune shared convolutional layers for both tasks. Specifically, we compute descriptors from linear or nonlinear filter bank responses on training images from both tasks, and use such descriptors to search for a desired subset of training samples for the source learning task.

Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level that totally eliminates the imbalance, whereas undersampling can perform better when the imbalance is only removed to some extent; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not necessarily cause overfitting of CNNs; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05381v1","cs.CV	cs.AI	cs.LG	cs.NE	stat.ML","A systematic study of the class imbalance problem in convolutional   neural networks","buda	atsuto}@kth.se	maciej.mazurowski@duke.edu"

Another shortcoming of NN is the lack of flexibility to customize different distributions for the weights and neurons according to the data, as is often done in probabilistic graphical models. To address these problems, we propose a class of probabilistic neural networks, dubbed natural-parameter networks (NPN), as a novel and lightweight Bayesian treatment of NN. NPN allows the usage of arbitrary exponential-family distributions to model the weights and neurons. Different from traditional NN and BNN, NPN takes distributions as input and goes through layers of transformation before producing distributions to match the target output distributions. As a Bayesian treatment, efficient backpropagation (BP) is performed to learn the natural parameters for the distributions over both the weights and neurons. The output distributions of each layer, as byproducts, may be used as second-order representations for the associated tasks such as link prediction.

However, the vast majority of medical investigators can only access de-identified notes, in order to protect the confidentiality of patients. In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines 18 types of protected health information (PHI) that needs to be removed to de-identify patient notes. Manual de-identification is impractical given the size of EHR databases, the limited number of researchers with access to the non-de-identified notes, and the frequent mistakes of human annotators.

Materials and Methods: We compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs), n-gram models, and approaches based on cTAKES that extract pre-defined medical concepts from clinical notes and use them to predict patient phenotypes. The performance is tested on 10 different phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge summaries extracted from the MIMIC-III database.   Results: CNNs outperform other phenotyping algorithms in all 10 tasks.

Our tests performed on the TIMIT database show that the performance does not degrade when the input window is shifted up to 5 frames in the past compared to common practice (no future frame). This corresponds to improving the latency by 50 ms in our settings. Our tests also show that the best results are not obtained with the symmetric window commonly employed, but with an asymmetric window with eight past and two future context frames, although this observation should be confirmed on other data sets. The reduction in latency suggested by our results is critical for specific applications such as real-time lip synchronisation for tele-presence, but may also be beneficial in general applications to improve the lag in human-machine spoken interaction.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09163v1","cs.CL	cs.CV	cs.NE	stat.ML","Optimising The Input Window Alignment in CD-DNN Based Phoneme   Recognition for Low Latency Processing","akashd@kth.se	giampi@kth.se"

Compared with text sources come from other domains, the medical text is special and has unique characteristics. In addition, the medical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same drug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset sources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a single drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those challenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN model, i.e., MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). The second technique involves two deep network classifiers, i.e., DBN (Deep Belief Networks), and SAE (Stacked Denoising Encoders). The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence that is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, i.e., LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average F-score being 0.8645.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01891v1","cs.CL	cs.AI	cs.LG	cs.NE	68Txx	I.2.4","A New Data Representation Based on Training Data Characteristics to   Extract Drug Named-Entity in Medical Text","mujiono.sadikin@mercubuana.ac.id"

Recently, deep learning approach has been applied to this problem and significant improvements have been achieved. In this paper, we propose to view the generation of the global interaction between two texts as a recursive process: i.e. the interaction of two texts at each position is a composition of the interactions between their prefixes as well as the word level interaction at the current position. Based on this idea, we propose a novel deep architecture, namely Match-SRNN, to model the recursive matching structure. Firstly, a tensor is constructed to capture the word level interactions. Then a spatial RNN is applied to integrate the local interactions recursively, with importance determined by four types of gates. Finally, the matching score is calculated based on the global interaction. We show that, after degenerated to the exact matching scenario, Match-SRNN can approximate the dynamic programming process of longest common subsequence. Thus, there exists a clear interpretation for Match-SRNN. Our experiments on two semantic matching tasks showed the effectiveness of Match-SRNN, and its ability of visualizing the learned matching structure.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04378v1","cs.CL	cs.AI	cs.LG	cs.NE","Match-SRNN: Modeling the Recursive Matching Structure with Spatial RNN","wanshengxian	pangliang}@software.ict.ac.cn	lanyanyan@ict.ac.cn	junxu@ict.ac.cn	guojiafeng@ict.ac.cn	cxq@ict.ac.cn"

Despite this ease of interpretation, the input switched affine network achieves reasonable performance on a text modeling tasks, and allows greater computational efficiency than networks with standard nonlinearities.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09434v2","cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.LG	cs.NE","Input Switched Affine Networks: An RNN Architecture Designed for   Interpretability",""

Recently, various methods for augmenting neural language models with an attention mechanism over a differentiable memory have been proposed. For predicting the next token, these models query information from a memory of the recent history which can facilitate learning mid- and long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention mechanisms used in memory-augmented neural language models produce a single output vector per time step. This vector is used both for predicting the next token as well as for the key and value of a differentiable memory of a token history. In this paper, we propose a neural language model with a key-value attention mechanism that outputs separate representations for the key and value of a differentiable memory, as well as for encoding the next-word distribution. This model outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora. Yet, we found that our method mainly utilizes a memory of the five most recent output representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much simpler model based only on the concatenation of recent output representations from previous time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented neural language models.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04521v1","cs.CL	cs.AI	cs.LG	cs.NE","Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling","michal.daniluk.15@ucl.ac.uk,	t.rocktaschel@cs.ucl.ac.uk	j.welbl@cs.ucl.ac.uk	s.riedel@cs.ucl.ac.uk"

We conduct a theoretical analysis of generalised bilinear operators that can be used to measure the $\ell_{2}$ relational distance between two word-pairs.

This paper builds on these efforts by further revising GRUs and proposing a simplified architecture potentially more suitable for speech recognition. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we suggest to remove the reset gate in the GRU design, resulting in a more efficient single-gate architecture. Second, we propose to replace tanh with ReLU activations in the state update equations.

A crucial design factor in evolutionary deep intelligence is the genetic encoding scheme used to simulate heredity and determine the architectures of offspring networks. In this study, we take a deeper look at the notion of synaptic cluster-driven evolution of deep neural networks which guides the evolution process towards the formation of a highly sparse set of synaptic clusters in offspring networks. Utilizing a synaptic cluster-driven genetic encoding, the probabilistic encoding of synaptic traits considers not only individual synaptic properties but also inter-synaptic relationships within a deep neural network. This process results in highly sparse offspring networks which are particularly tailored for parallel computational devices such as GPUs and deep neural network accelerator chips.

MVPA methods utilize machine learning algorithms to distinguish among types of information or cognitive states represented in the brain, based on distributed patterns of neural activity. In the current investigation, we propose a new approach for representation of neural data for pattern analysis, namely a Mesh Learning Model. In this approach, at each time instant, a star mesh is formed around each voxel, such that the voxel corresponding to the center node is surrounded by its p-nearest neighbors. The arc weights of each mesh are estimated from the voxel intensity values by least squares method. The estimated arc weights of all the meshes, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs), are then used to train a classifier, such as Neural Networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Na\""ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The proposed Mesh Model was tested on neuroimaging data acquired via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a recognition memory experiment using categorized word lists, employing a previously established experimental paradigm (\""Oztekin & Badre, 2011).

On-line planning with look-ahead trees has proven successful in environments where transition models are known a priori. However, in complex environments where transition models need to be learned from data, the deficiencies of learned models have limited their utility for planning. To address these challenges, we propose TreeQN, a differentiable, recursive, tree-structured model that serves as a drop-in replacement for any value function network in deep RL with discrete actions. TreeQN dynamically constructs a tree by recursively applying a transition model in a learned abstract state space and then aggregating predicted rewards and state-values using a tree backup to estimate Q-values.

For this reason, full backpropagation through time is rarely used on long sequences, and truncated backpropagation through time is used as a heuristic. However, this usually leads to biased estimates of the gradient in which longer term dependencies are ignored. Addressing this issue, we propose an alternative algorithm, Sparse Attentive Backtracking, which might also be related to principles used by brains to learn long-term dependencies. Sparse Attentive Backtracking learns an attention mechanism over the hidden states of the past and selectively backpropagates through paths with high attention weights.

One very useful approach to estimating the amount of bias in a representation comes from maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) [5], a measure of distance between probability distributions.

We present an Evolutionary Deep Learning (EDL) algorithm that automatically solves this by identifying the question type with high accuracy, along with a proposed deep architecture. Typically, a significant amount of human insight and preparation is required prior to executing machine learning algorithms. For example, when creating deep neural networks, the number of parameters must be selected in advance and furthermore, a lot of these choices are made based upon pre-existing knowledge of the data such as the use of a categorical cross entropy loss function. Humans are able to study a dataset and decide whether it represents a classification or a regression problem, and consequently make decisions which will be applied to the execution of the neural network. We propose the Automated Problem Identification (API) algorithm, which uses an evolutionary algorithm interface to TensorFlow to manipulate a deep neural network to decide if a dataset represents a classification or a regression problem. We test API on 16 different classification, regression and sentiment analysis datasets with up to 10,000 features and up to 17,000 unique target values. API achieves an average accuracy of $96.3\%$ in identifying the problem type without hardcoding any insights about the general characteristics of regression or classification problems. For example, API successfully identifies classification problems even with 1000 target values. Furthermore, the algorithm recommends which loss function to use and also recommends a neural network architecture. Our work is therefore a step towards fully automated machine learning.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00703v1","cs.NE	cs.AI	cs.LG	stat.ML","Automated Problem Identification: Regression vs Classification via   Evolutionary Deep Networks","edufourq@gmail.com,	bruce.a.bassett@gmail.com"

To increase their flexibility, several authors have proposed methods for adapting the activation functions themselves, endowing them with varying degrees of flexibility. None of these approaches, however, have gained wide acceptance in practice, and research in this topic remains open. In this paper, we introduce a novel family of flexible activation functions that are based on an inexpensive kernel expansion at every neuron. Leveraging over several properties of kernel-based models, we propose multiple variations for designing and initializing these kernel activation functions (KAFs), including a multidimensional scheme allowing to nonlinearly combine information from different paths in the network. The resulting KAFs can approximate any mapping defined over a subset of the real line, either convex or nonconvex. Furthermore, they are smooth over their entire domain, linear in their parameters, and they can be regularized using any known scheme, including the use of $\ell_1$ penalties to enforce sparseness. To the best of our knowledge, no other known model satisfies all these properties simultaneously. In addition, we provide a relatively complete overview on alternative techniques for adapting the activation functions, which is currently lacking in the literature.

While dropout only regularizes this quantity up to a point, batch normalization implicitly discourages single direction reliance, in part by decreasing the class selectivity of individual units.

Identifying such structures present in the task provides ways to simplify and speed up reinforcement learning algorithms. These structures also help to generalize such algorithms over multiple tasks without relearning policies from scratch. We use ideas from dynamical systems to find metastable regions in the state space and associate them with abstract states. The spectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitable abstractions aligned to the underlying structure. Skills are defined in terms of the sequence of actions that lead to transitions between such abstract states. The connectivity information from PCCA+ is used to generate these skills or options. These skills are independent of the learning task and can be efficiently reused across a variety of tasks defined over the same model. This approach works well even without the exact model of the environment by using sample trajectories to construct an approximate estimate. We also present our approach to scaling the skill acquisition framework to complex tasks with large state spaces for which we perform state aggregation using the representation learned from an action conditional video prediction network and use the skill acquisition framework on the aggregated state space.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05359v2","cs.LG	cs.AI	cs.CV	cs.NE","Option Discovery in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning using   Spatio-Temporal Clustering","aravindsrinivas@gmail.com	nandparikrish@gmail.com	agoovi@gmail.com	ravi@cse.iitm.ac.in"

Moreover, residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the short paths during training. To support this observation, we rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional models, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient throughout the extent of very deep networks.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06431v2","cs.CV	cs.AI	cs.LG	cs.NE","Residual Networks Behave Like Ensembles of Relatively Shallow Networks","av443@cornell.edu	mjw285@cornell.edu	sjb344@cornell.edu"

The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the optimization difficulty involved when the intermediate pre-training is not performed is due to the {\em composition} of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of optimization problems with deep learning, presumably because of effective local minima.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.4083v6","cs.LG	cs.CV	cs.NE	stat.ML","Knowledge Matters: Importance of Prior Information for Optimization","gulcehrc@iro.umontreal.ca	bengioy@iro.umontreal.ca"

One of the key limitations of deconvolutional operations is that they result in the so-called checkerboard problem. This is caused by the fact that no direct relationship exists among adjacent pixels on the output feature map. To address this problem, we propose the pixel deconvolutional layer (PixelDCL) to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature map. Our method is based on a fresh interpretation of the regular deconvolution operation. The resulting PixelDCL can be used to replace any deconvolutional layer in a plug-and-play manner without compromising the fully trainable capabilities of original models. The proposed PixelDCL may result in slight decrease in efficiency, but this can be overcome by an implementation trick. Experimental results on semantic segmentation demonstrate that PixelDCL can consider spatial features such as edges and shapes and yields more accurate segmentation outputs than deconvolutional layers. When used in image generation tasks, our PixelDCL can largely overcome the checkerboard problem suffered by regular deconvolution operations.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06820v4","cs.LG	cs.CV	cs.NE	stat.ML","Pixel Deconvolutional Networks","hongyang.gao@wsu.edu	hao.yuan@wsu.edu	zwang6@eecs.wsu.edu	sji@eecs.wsu.edu"

The representation of spatial knowledge is often modeled with spatial templates, i.e., regions of acceptability of two objects under an explicit spatial relationship (e.g., ""on"", ""below"", etc.). In contrast with prior work that restricts spatial templates to explicit spatial prepositions (e.g., ""glass on table""), here we extend this concept to implicit spatial language, i.e., those relationships (generally actions) for which the spatial arrangement of the objects is only implicitly implied (e.g., ""man riding horse""). In contrast with explicit relationships, predicting spatial arrangements from implicit spatial language requires significant common sense spatial understanding. Here, we introduce the task of predicting spatial templates for two objects under a relationship, which can be seen as a spatial question-answering task with a (2D) continuous output (""where is the man w.r.t. a horse when the man is walking the horse?"").

In this paper, we study the problem of automatically grading the kinds of open response mathematical questions that figure prominently in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses. Our data-driven framework for mathematical language processing (MLP) leverages solution data from a large number of learners to evaluate the correctness of their solutions, assign partial-credit scores, and provide feedback to each learner on the likely locations of any errors. MLP takes inspiration from the success of natural language processing for text data and comprises three main steps. First, we convert each solution to an open response mathematical question into a series of numerical features. Second, we cluster the features from several solutions to uncover the structures of correct, partially correct, and incorrect solutions. We develop two different clustering approaches, one that leverages generic clustering algorithms and one based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Third, we automatically grade the remaining (potentially large number of) solutions based on their assigned cluster and one instructor-provided grade per cluster. As a bonus, we can track the cluster assignment of each step of a multistep solution and determine when it departs from a cluster of correct solutions, which enables us to indicate the likely locations of errors to learners. We test and validate MLP on real-world MOOC data to demonstrate how it can substantially reduce the human effort required in large-scale educational platforms.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.04346v1","stat.ML	cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.LG","Mathematical Language Processing: Automatic Grading and Feedback for   Open Response Mathematical Questions","mr.lan@sparfa.com	dvats@sparfa.com	waters@sparfa.com	richb@sparfa.com"

In this paper, we develop a novel machine learning method called nonparametric Bayesian double articulation analyzer (NPB-DAA) that can directly acquire language and acoustic models from observed continuous speech signals. For this purpose, we propose an integrative generative model that combines a language model and an acoustic model into a single generative model called the ""hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden language model"" (HDP-HLM). The HDP-HLM is obtained by extending the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden semi-Markov model (HDP-HSMM) proposed by Johnson et al. An inference procedure for the HDP-HLM is derived using the blocked Gibbs sampler originally proposed for the HDP-HSMM. This procedure enables the simultaneous and direct inference of language and acoustic models from continuous speech signals. Based on the HDP-HLM and its inference procedure, we developed a novel double articulation analyzer. By assuming HDP-HLM as a generative model of observed time series data, and by inferring latent variables of the model, the method can analyze latent double articulation structure, i.e., hierarchically organized latent words and phonemes, of the data in an unsupervised manner. The novel unsupervised double articulation analyzer is called NPB-DAA.   The NPB-DAA can automatically estimate double articulation structure embedded in speech signals. We also carried out two evaluation experiments using synthetic data and actual human continuous speech signals representing Japanese vowel sequences. In the word acquisition and phoneme categorization tasks, the NPB-DAA outperformed a conventional double articulation analyzer (DAA) and baseline automatic speech recognition system whose acoustic model was trained in a supervised manner.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06646v2","cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.LG	stat.ML","Nonparametric Bayesian Double Articulation Analyzer for Direct Language   Acquisition from Continuous Speech Signals",""

Additionally, the uncertain task-pairs, i.e., the ones with extremely asymmetric transfer scores, may collectively mislead clustering algorithms to output an inaccurate task-partition.

Contrary to previous works in multimodal sentiment analysis which focus on holistic information in speech segments such as bag of words representations and average facial expression intensity, we develop a novel deep architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis that performs modality fusion at the word level. In this paper, we propose the Gated Multimodal Embedding LSTM with Temporal Attention (GME-LSTM(A)) model that is composed of 2 modules. The Gated Multimodal Embedding alleviates the difficulties of fusion when there are noisy modalities. The LSTM with Temporal Attention performs word level fusion at a finer fusion resolution between input modalities and attends to the most important time steps. As a result, the GME-LSTM(A) is able to better model the multimodal structure of speech through time and perform better sentiment comprehension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the publicly-available Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis (CMU-MOSI) dataset by achieving state-of-the-art sentiment classification and regression results. Qualitative analysis on our model emphasizes the importance of the Temporal Attention Layer in sentiment prediction because the additional acoustic and visual modalities are noisy.

However, inherent structure in our world and bias in our language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than visual modalities, resulting in models that ignore visual information, leading to an inflated sense of their capability.   We propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance the popular VQA dataset by collecting complementary images such that every question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image, but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our complete balanced dataset is publicly available at www.visualqa.org as part of the 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Dataset and Challenge (VQA v2.0).   We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced dataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset, suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors. This finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems to be a qualitative sense among practitioners.   Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images enables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides a counter-example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an image that is similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the same question.

Specifically, we pose a cooperative 'image guessing' game between two agents -- Qbot and Abot -- who communicate in natural language dialog so that Qbot can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.   We demonstrate two experimental results.   First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabulary, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among 'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.   Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset, where we pretrain with supervised dialog data and show that the RL 'fine-tuned' agents significantly outperform SL agents. Interestingly, the RL Qbot learns to ask questions that Abot is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06585v2","cs.CV	cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.LG","Learning Cooperative Visual Dialog Agents with Deep Reinforcement   Learning",""
"Wei-Lun Chao	Hexiang Hu	Fei Sha","24","4","2017","Visual question answering (QA) has attracted a lot of attention lately, seen essentially as a form of (visual) Turing test that artificial intelligence should strive to achieve. In this paper, we study a crucial component of this task: how can we design good datasets for the task? We focus on the design of multiple-choice based datasets where the learner has to select the right answer from a set of candidate ones including the target (i.e. the correct one) and the decoys (i.e. the incorrect ones). Through careful analysis of the results attained by state-of-the-art learning models and human annotators on existing datasets, we show the design of the decoy answers has a significant impact on how and what the learning models learn from the datasets. In particular, the resulting learner can ignore the visual information, the question, or the both while still doing well on the task. Inspired by this, we propose automatic procedures to remedy such design deficiencies. We apply the procedures to re-construct decoy answers for two popular visual QA datasets as well as to create a new visual QA dataset from the Visual Genome project, resulting in the largest dataset for this task. Extensive empirical studies show that the design deficiencies have been alleviated in the remedied datasets and the performance on them is likely a more faithful indicator of the difference among learning models. The datasets are released and publicly available via http://www.teds.usc.edu/website_vqa/.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07121v1","cs.CL	cs.AI	cs.CV	cs.LG","Being Negative but Constructively: Lessons Learnt from Creating Better   Visual Question Answering Datasets","weilunc@usc.edu,	hexiang.frank.hu@gmail.com,	feisha@usc.edu"
"Aishwarya Agrawal	Aniruddha Kembhavi	Dhruv Batra	Devi Parikh","26","4","2017","Visual Question Answering (VQA) has received a lot of attention over the past couple of years. A number of deep learning models have been proposed for this task. However, it has been shown that these models are heavily driven by superficial correlations in the training data and lack compositionality -- the ability to answer questions about unseen compositions of seen concepts. This compositionality is desirable and central to intelligence. In this paper, we propose a new setting for Visual Question Answering where the test question-answer pairs are compositionally novel compared to training question-answer pairs. To facilitate developing models under this setting, we present a new compositional split of the VQA v1.0 dataset, which we call Compositional VQA (C-VQA). We analyze the distribution of questions and answers in the C-VQA splits. Finally, we evaluate several existing VQA models under this new setting and show that the performances of these models degrade by a significant amount compared to the original VQA setting.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08243v1","cs.CV	cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.LG","C-VQA: A Compositional Split of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v1.0   Dataset","aish@vt.edu,	anik@allenai.org,	dbatra@gatech.edu	parikh@gatech.edu"

"Xu Sun	Xuancheng Ren	Shuming Ma	Houfeng Wang","19","6","2017","We propose a simple yet effective technique for neural network learning. The forward propagation is computed as usual. In back propagation, only a small subset of the full gradient is computed to update the model parameters. The gradient vectors are sparsified in such a way that only the top-$k$ elements (in terms of magnitude) are kept. As a result, only $k$ rows or columns (depending on the layout) of the weight matrix are modified, leading to a linear reduction ($k$ divided by the vector dimension) in the computational cost. Surprisingly, experimental results demonstrate that we can update only 1--4\% of the weights at each back propagation pass. This does not result in a larger number of training iterations. More interestingly, the accuracy of the resulting models is actually improved rather than degraded, and a detailed analysis is given.

"Suranjana Samanta	Sameep Mehta","10","7","2017","Adversarial samples are strategically modified samples, which are crafted with the purpose of fooling a classifier at hand. An attacker introduces specially crafted adversarial samples to a deployed classifier, which are being mis-classified by the classifier. However, the samples are perceived to be drawn from entirely different classes and thus it becomes hard to detect the adversarial samples. Most of the prior works have been focused on synthesizing adversarial samples in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a new method of crafting adversarial text samples by modification of the original samples. Modifications of the original text samples are done by deleting or replacing the important or salient words in the text or by introducing new words in the text sample. Our algorithm works best for the datasets which have sub-categories within each of the classes of examples. While crafting adversarial samples, one of the key constraint is to generate meaningful sentences which can at pass off as legitimate from language (English) viewpoint. Experimental results on IMDB movie review dataset for sentiment analysis and Twitter dataset for gender detection show the efficiency of our proposed method.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02812v1","cs.LG	cs.AI	cs.CL	cs.CV","Towards Crafting Text Adversarial Samples","suransam@in.ibm.com	sameepmehta@in.ibm.com"

First, using policy gradient and mixed-loss methods for reinforcement learning, we directly optimize sentence-level task-based metrics (as rewards), achieving significant improvements over the baseline, based on both automatic metrics and human evaluation on multiple datasets. Next, we propose a novel entailment-enhanced reward (CIDEnt) that corrects phrase-matching based metrics (such as CIDEr) to only allow for logically-implied partial matches and avoid contradictions, achieving further significant improvements over the CIDEr-reward model. Overall, our CIDEnt-reward model achieves the new state-of-the-art on the MSR-VTT dataset.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02300v1","cs.CL	cs.AI	cs.CV	cs.LG","Reinforced Video Captioning with Entailment Rewards","ram@cs.unc.edu	mbansal@cs.unc.edu"
